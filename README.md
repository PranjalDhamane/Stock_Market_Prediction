# Stock_Market_Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict tomorrow's S&P 500 index price using historical data from 1990 to 2024. In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive guide to download, clean, and prepare data for machine learning, train a model, and avoid common pitfalls such as overfitting. We'll utilize a Random Forest model for prediction and backtesting for validation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- `yfinance`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these packages using pip:
```sh
pip install yfinance pandas scikit-learn
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Acquisition
We'll start by downloading the S&P 500 prices using the `yfinance` package. This package allows us to easily fetch historical market data.

### Data Preparation
Using `pandas`, we'll clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning. This includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and creating the target variable.

### Model Training
We'll train a Random Forest model on the prepared data. The Random Forest algorithm is chosen due to its robustness and ability to handle various types of data.

### Backtesting
To validate the model, we'll use backtesting. This involves making predictions on historical data and comparing them to actual outcomes to gauge model performance. Initially, the model's accuracy was 0.5281. After backtesting and improvements, the accuracy increased to 0.5592.

### Model Improvement
We'll iterate on the model by adding more predictors and fine-tuning hyperparameters to enhance accuracy.

## Next Steps
- Explore additional predictors such as technical indicators or macroeconomic factors.
- Experiment with different machine learning models.
- Implement more advanced backtesting techniques.
- Use cross-validation to further ensure the model's robustness.
